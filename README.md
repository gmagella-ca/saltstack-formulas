# saltstack-formulas
I'll put in this repo, some saltstack formulas I'm writing, feel free to copy them and use at your own risk

In order to use this formula, I'd suggest creating a folder, eg: ```/srv/formulas/stackdriver-formula/``` cloning this repo to that folder.
Then you'd edit your /etc/salt/master and add into your file_roots this location.
